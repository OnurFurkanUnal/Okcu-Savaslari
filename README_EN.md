# Okcu-Savaslari

My first mobile game. I finished it in 4 months total. Due to our limited budget, our game has some shortcomings. Server and game are completely designed by me. Only logo and character drawing were purchased. Our server costs $10 per month. I didn't see the need to fix some shortcomings in the game until I reached a thousand active players daily. These shortcomings are:
- Safetynet: Checks whether the game is original as downloaded.
- Act : It is used to preserve the variables in memory. And to protect important values ​​from memory scans

- Client-Side Prediction and Server Reconciliation: Our server is authorized but there is no Server Reconciliation. Because we did not embed unity engineering on our server because of the cost. If we reach a thousand active players per day, we will strengthen our server and simulate the game on our server.
- Since our game is new, we assume that no one is cheating and we do everything on the client. This poses a risk to us, but we don't think it will be a problem up to a certain level. Because it is difficult for normal players to understand this shortcoming.
